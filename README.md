simply add your interview token into the quotes next to "token" in config.json, then add your guilds in the guild slot with a comma seperating the ids.
feel free to reach out to me on tele for support / help. https://t.me/socialrot

the accepter.py is to create the interview gcs, making them follow instructions. the thanks.py is to steal gc's claiming os before other interview bots have a chance of claiming it.
^ if you need help with the differance, dm me on tele
